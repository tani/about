<h1 class="text-center">Hello, I am TANIGUCHI Masaya</h1>

TANIGUCHI Masaya is a second-year Ph.D. student in
Tojo laboratory, Graduate School of Advanced Science and Technology, Japan
Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. His supervisor is Satoshi Tojo. He
did a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at Gakushuin University, and did a
Master of Science in Information Science at Japan Advanced Institute of Science
and Technology. His research interests lie in the area of formal semantics of
natural language, and programming language.
